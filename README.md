# Online Portfolio
## Description
This is my online portfolio. The purpose of this page is to provide potential employers everything they need to know about my work. The page will include a short 'About Me' section,
describing what I do, what I've done, and how long I've been doing it, as well as information about what I want to accomplish. The page also includes a section for my work, with links
to various deployed projects. Finally, the page lists my contact information: my phone number, email, and github page. This page is a work-in-progress, and is intended to be tweaked, improved, and further populated as my skills improve and my body of work expands.
